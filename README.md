# Facebook-web - React Project

## Overview
This project is a **Facebook clone** built using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**. It replicates the core features of Facebook, including a responsive header, a post feed, stories, and a sidebar with navigation and contacts. I learned how to structure a React application, manage state, and create reusable components. Additionally, I implemented responsive design using Tailwind CSS and integrated TypeScript for type safety.

### Key Features
- **Responsive Header**: Includes a search bar, navigation icons, and user profile options.
- **Post Feed**: Users can create posts, like, comment, and share.
- **Stories Section**: Displays user stories in a horizontal scrollable format.
- **Sidebar**: Contains navigation links and a contacts list.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

**Install dependencies**: npm install

**Run the server**: npm run dev

**Server in port**http://localhost:5173
